# OAuth Refresh Token Security & Functional Improvements

This document summarizes the comprehensive security hardening and functional improvements implemented for the OAuth refresh token system.

## üîí Critical Security Fixes

### 1. IV Reuse Vulnerability (HIGH RISK) - FIXED
**Problem**: Same initialization vector (IV) was used for both access and refresh token encryption, allowing cryptographic attacks.

**Solution**: 
- Generate separate random IVs for each token type
- Store `refreshTokenIv` separately in encrypted token structure
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing tokens

**Files Modified**: 
- `apps/proxy-worker/src/utils/crypto.ts`
- `apps/proxy-worker/src/types/index.ts`

### 2. Weak Key Derivation (MEDIUM RISK) - FIXED
**Problem**: Encryption key was created by padding secret with zeros, reducing effective entropy.

**Solution**:
- Implement PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Use proper salt ("cyrus-oauth-salt-v1") for deterministic keys
- Upgrade to AES-256 equivalent security

**Files Modified**: `apps/proxy-worker/src/utils/crypto.ts`

### 3. Error Information Leakage (MEDIUM RISK) - FIXED
**Problem**: Linear API error details were exposed to clients, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Solution**:
- Sanitize error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Log full errors internally for debugging
- Return generic error messages to prevent information disclosure

**Files Modified**: `apps/proxy-worker/src/services/OAuthService.ts`

## üöÄ Functional Improvements

### 4. Concurrency Control - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Multiple EdgeWorkers could refresh the same token simultaneously, causing race conditions.

**Solution**:
- In-memory lock mechanism using `Map<string, Promise<OAuthToken>>`
- Concurrent requests wait for existing refresh to complete
- Automatic lock cleanup after completion

**Files Modified**: `apps/proxy-worker/src/services/OAuthService.ts`

### 5. Exponential Backoff & Retry Logic - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Network failures during token refresh had no retry mechanism.

**Solution**:
- Exponential backoff with jitter (1s, 2s, 4s base delays)
- Distinguish between retryable (5xx, 429) and permanent (4xx) errors
- Network error detection and automatic retry (up to 3 attempts)

**Files Modified**: `packages/edge-worker/src/EdgeWorker.ts`

### 6. Rate Limiting - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: No protection against refresh token abuse or DoS attacks.

**Solution**:
- 10 requests per minute per workspace limit
- Sliding window rate limiting using KV storage
- Proper HTTP 429 responses with Retry-After headers

**Files Modified**: `apps/proxy-worker/src/index.ts`

### 7. Enhanced Token Validation - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Insufficient validation of token refresh responses and scope changes.

**Solution**:
- Validate required fields in Linear's token response
- Monitor and log scope changes for security
- Enhanced token expiration and structure validation

**Files Modified**: `apps/proxy-worker/src/services/OAuthService.ts`

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### 8. Comprehensive Logging - IMPLEMENTED
**Features**:
- Structured logging with timestamps and context
- Success/failure metrics for monitoring
- Rate limit violations tracking
- Token scope change alerts
- Network error categorization

### 9. Health Check Endpoint - IMPLEMENTED
**Endpoint**: `GET /health`

**Checks**:
- KV storage connectivity (OAUTH_TOKENS, OAUTH_STATE)
- Linear API basic connectivity
- Overall service health assessment
- Proper HTTP status codes (200/503) for monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Encryption**: AES-GCM with proper key derivation and unique IVs
2. **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages, internal logging
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
4. **Token Security**: No refresh tokens in HTTP responses
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for security analysis
6. **Validation**: Strict token response validation
7. **Concurrency**: Race condition prevention

## üìà Performance & Reliability

1. **Retry Logic**: Automatic recovery from transient failures
2. **Backoff Strategy**: Prevents thundering herd problems
3. **Lock Management**: Efficient concurrency control
4. **Error Classification**: Smart retry decisions
5. **Health Monitoring**: Proactive service monitoring

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All improvements maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing encrypted tokens can still be decrypted
- API contracts unchanged for EdgeWorker integration
- Graceful fallback for missing refreshTokenIv field

## ‚ö° Production Readiness

The implementation now includes:
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade security
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Production monitoring capabilities
- ‚úÖ Scalable architecture patterns
- ‚úÖ Proper rate limiting and abuse prevention
- ‚úÖ Health check for load balancer integration
- ‚úÖ Structured logging for observability platforms

## üö® Migration Notes

**For existing deployments**:
1. Deploy proxy worker with new encryption (backward compatible)
2. Monitor logs for any decryption issues
3. Existing tokens will work but new tokens get enhanced security
4. Health check endpoint available at `/health`
5. Rate limiting active (10 req/min per workspace)

**Environment Requirements**:
- No new environment variables required
- Existing ENCRYPTION_KEY continues to work
- Enhanced logging may increase log volume

This comprehensive security hardening addresses all critical vulnerabilities identified in the technical review while significantly improving the system's reliability and production readiness.
